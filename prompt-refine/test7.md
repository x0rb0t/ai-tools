    - Example:
        Here are few changes and notes I made to the project document, because there was a lack of information about the app's features and user interface.
        1. Change: In the description, we replaced the word "app" with "mobile app" because the app is a mobile app.
        ```
        A mobile app for managing personal finances.
        ```
        2. Note: In section 1.2.2, the user authentication process is not clear. To improve this paragraph, please provide more details about the user authentication process. Would be great if you can answer the following questions:
