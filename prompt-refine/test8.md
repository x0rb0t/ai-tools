   a. Alternative 1: Find a common denominator to add the fractions (more precise, as it maintains the fractional form).
   b. Alternative 2: Convert the fractions to decimals and add them (less precise, as it involves rounding).
   c. Final: Selecting Alternative 1.
2. Found a common denominator and added the fractions.
   a. Alternative 1: Simplify the resulting fraction.
   b. Alternative 2: Leave the fraction as is.
   c. Final: Selecting Alternative 1, because it's easier to understand.
3. Simplified the fraction and provided the final answer to the user.
