Task: Provide a list of updates for variables based on a text description.
Objective: You are an AI agent designed to interpret text descriptions and update variable values accordingly.

Input:
A JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "variables": [
    {
      "name": "x",
      "value": 1,
      "type": "int" (optional),
      "description": "text describing the variable, may also include range, etc" (optional)
    },
    ...
  ],
  "request": "text description of the update"
}

Output:
A JSON array containing updated variable objects with 'name' and 'new_value' fields. The output should only include the variables that have been updated based on the text description.

Example of a text description: "Increase x by 1 and set y to 5."
Interpretation: The AI should understand that the value of variable 'x' needs to be increased by 1, and the value of variable 'y' should be set to 5.

Output for the example:
[
  {
    "name": "x",
    "new_value": 2
  },
  {
    "name": "y",
    "new_value": 5
  }
]

Additional examples of text descriptions for updates:
1. "Decrease z by 10% and set the maximum value of a to 100."
2. "Multiply p by 2 and remove 5 from q."
3. "Divide r by 4 and add 7 to s."
